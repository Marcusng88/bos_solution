   - Critical (95%+): 1.0 risk score
   - High (85-95%): 0.8 risk score
   - Medium (75-85%): 0.6 risk score
   - Low (50-75%): 0.3 risk score
   - Safe (<50%): 0.0 risk score

2. **Profit Performance Risk (30%)**
   - Severe Loss (-20%+): 1.0 risk score
   - Significant Loss (-10% to -20%): 0.8 risk score
   - Loss (0% to -10%): 0.6 risk score
   - Low Profit (0% to 10%): 0.3 risk score
   - Good Profit (10%+): 0.0 risk score

3. **Performance Metrics Risk (20%)**
   - CTR < 1%: +0.5 risk
   - CTR 1-2%: +0.3 risk
   - CPC > $5: +0.5 risk
   - CPC $3-5: +0.3 risk
   - Conversion Rate < 1%: +0.5 risk
   - Conversion Rate 1-2%: +0.3 risk

4. **Spending Velocity Risk (10%)**
   - Extremely Rapid (<5 days): 1.0 risk score
   - Rapid (5-10 days): 0.8 risk score
   - Above Average (10-15 days): 0.5 risk score
   - Normal (>15 days): 0.0 risk score

### Final Risk Levels:
- **Critical Risk**: 0.8+ (80%+ overall risk)
- **High Risk**: 0.6-0.79 (60-79% overall risk)
- **Medium Risk**: 0.4-0.59 (40-59% overall risk)
- **Low Risk**: <0.4 (<40% overall risk)
